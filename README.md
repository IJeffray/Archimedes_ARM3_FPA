This is my implementation of an ARM3 upgrade card with FPA that will plug in to the ARM2 socket on early model Acorn Archimedes machines.

The non-FPA version has been tested successfully over a dozen builds using 25MHz and 33MHz parts recovered from dead A5000 machines, and my A540 ARM3 FPA card has been successfully tested in serveral systems, so this project simply brings those two projects together.

Work in progress...
